"""
run_e2e_tests.py — live end-to-end testing of the Socratic-OT backend.

Hits a running uvicorn instance on localhost:8000, drives 5 scripted
student trajectories through POST /chat, captures tutor responses,
runs assertions per turn, and writes a markdown report to test.md.

Each scenario uses POST /sessions/{id}/reset to start from a clean
checkpoint. The student inputs are hardcoded in SCENARIOS — that's the
"answer the question yourself" part of the brief.

Usage:
    PYTHONPATH=backend python3 backend/run_e2e_tests.py

Requires:
  - uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000
  - Valid ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or AWS Bedrock creds + LLM_PROVIDER=bedrock)
  - ChromaDB populated (data/processed/chroma_db/)

    # Each FN11-FN20 includes ≥2 hint turns. These exercise the
    # hint_error_function.txt prompt's HARD RULES across diverse
    # student-input shapes:
    #   • RULE 1: never re-ask "what structure does X"
    #   • RULE 2: don't bundle location AND function in the same hint
    #   • RULE 3: don't reveal the function description itself
    #   • RULE 4: acknowledge the student's wording verbatim
    #   • RULE 5: no sycophancy
    #   • RULE 7: exactly one '?' per hint
    # All scenarios assert no_placeholder_leak as a regression guard for
    # the 2026-05-02 [the target structure] bug.
